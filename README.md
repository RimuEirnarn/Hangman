A simple hangman game built with Python.

## Installation (no root required)

Non-venv installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RimuEirnarn/Hangman
cd Hangman
pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

Venv installation

### Notice

if you're running on Windows machine, make sure to use other command line program, CMD may have the same bug addressed in [here](https://github.com/RimuEirnarn/PyMarquee) and make sure to replace python3 with py3 and pip3 with py3 -m pip like this (non-venv):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RimuEirnarn/Hangman
cd Hangman
py3 -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt
py3 main.py
```
